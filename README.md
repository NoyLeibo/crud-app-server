# Product Inventory Server

Welcome! üëã

This is a simple, modern Node.js server for managing a product inventory. It was built as a home assignment, but with real-world best practices in mind. The API is clean, the code is TypeScript, and the database is MongoDB (via Mongoose). If you want to run, test, or extend it you're in the right place!
